`Forever Scalable`

**piedpy** is a Python based CLI toolkit for MySQL with auto-completion, key binders and syntax highlighting.

## Compatibility
piedpy works flawlessly  with Linux, OSX, and Windows and requires Python `3.8` or later. 


## Features

    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names.
* Support for multiline queries.
* Favorite queries with optional positional parameters. Save a query using
  `\fs alias query` and execute it with `\f alias` whenever you need.
* Timing of sql statements and table rendering.
* Config file is automatically created at ``~/.piedpyrc`` at first launch.
